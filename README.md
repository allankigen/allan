Hi, I'm Allan! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Mobile Game Developer** and **3D artist** living in Eldoret, Kenya. My first title, [Nganya Unlimited Rongai](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KeybetStudios.NURongai), a driving simulation is the most downloaded game on the Play Store in Kenya with over 500k installs.

I'm interested in trying my hand out at Frontend Development and I'm looking for opportunities to grow and further my craft.

When not working, I'm likely meditating, watching anime, playing games on my PC, or hanging out with friends.
